===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

=====================================

## what needs doing 

### The game functions correctly and runs error free

Player can not move off screen
Vehicles cross the screen
Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
Vehicle-player collision resets the game
Something happens when player wins

### Object-oriente 

Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
