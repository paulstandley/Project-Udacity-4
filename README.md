## what needs doing

~~The game functions correctly and runs error free~~

~~Player can not move off screen~~

~~Vehicles cross the screen~~

~~Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)~~

~~Vehicle-player collision resets the game~~

~~Something happens when player wins~~

~~Basic Functionality~~

~~In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.~~
