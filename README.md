===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

Project Brake down
==================

## what needs doing 

### The game functions correctly and runs error free

~~Player can not move off screen~~

~~Vehicles cross the screen~~

~~Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)~~

~~Vehicle-player collision resets the game~~

Something happens when player wins

### Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

Frogger Game Description
Your implementation must at minimum follow the basic functionality, but you can add additional optional functionality to your game, if you wish.

## ~~Basic Functionality~~

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.


## Additional Functionality

In addition to the basic functionality, you can add more cool functionality to your game. For example, here are some additional features that you can add:

Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. You can use the different character images provided in the images folder (weâ€™ll get to that below).

Score: you can implement a score for the game. For example, the score can increase each time the player reaches the water, and it can be reset to 0 when collision occurs (or it can be reduced).

Collectibles: you can add gems to the game, allowing the player to collect them to make the game more interesting.
